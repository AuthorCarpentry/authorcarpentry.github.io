# Author Carpentry                
https://doi.org/10.7907/Z96H4FFZ

Welcome to the master repository for Author Carpentry , a researcher-to-researcher training and outreach program in open authoring and publishing, scholarly identity and reputation, and research impact. Inspired by the [Modern Scientific Authoring]
(http://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/) program proposed by Software Carpentry founder Greg Wilson, AuthorCarpentry builds on Greg's vision to complement and extend the research pipelines covered in Software and Data Carpentry. AuthorCarpentry picks up with  the "last mile" of the research process: writing, reporting, review, dissemination and licensing, impact measurement, and establishing author identity and reputation (as shown in the illustration below).

## Topics covered in Author Carpentry include

* Scientific writing in useful, powerful, and open mark-up languages such as LaTeX and Markdown; 
* Formulating and managing citation data, publication lists, and bibliographies in open formats such as BiBTeX and using open source tools such as JabRef;
* Transforming author's  metadata documenting their research outputs into open plain text formats using command line tools, for reuse in research information systems in support of funder compliance mandates and institutional reporting.
* Establishing scholarly identity with ORCiD and managing reputation with ORCiD-enabled shclarly sharing platforms such as ScienceOpen
* Determining authorship, contributorship, and copyright ownership in collaborative research projects
* Demonstrating best practices in attribution, acknowledgement, and citation, particularly for non-traditional research outputs (software, datasets)
* Identifying reputable Open Access publications
* Scholarly annotation and open peer review
* Investigating and managing copyright status of a work, and evaluating conditions for Fair Use
* Open sharing of research using Creative Commons licenses, waivers, and public domain marks
Author Carpentry developers and instructors who are certified Insturctors in Dta/Software Carpentry and commit to the instructional approaches, assessment methods, and lesson formatting of the Carpentries.  


## Why would Librarians be involved in Author Carpentry?

Research librarians have long shared expertise in authoring and publishing with our campus communities, and we have developed considerable expertise in knowledge management principles and practices; instruction and assessment; information ethics and law, responsible conduct of research; and research information systems. Moreover, we share a vision for equal and universal access to information and culture as a basic human right, enthusiastically promoting the goals of the Open Source, Open Science, and Open Access movements. 

The Caltech Library is recasting its instructional program using a 'Carpentry' approach to better meet the needs of successful, time-constrained, and (understandably) often pre-occupied scientists and scholars, while advancing new forms of scholarly communication that improve access, re-use, and replication of scientific claims. The desired outcome is a set of pragmatic, efficient and useful Author Carpentry lessons that can be offered alone as 'tips and tools' sessions; in combination as a half-day or full-day workshop; or as snap-on modules to enhance existing Open Science and Research Data management programs.
