# Author Carpentry                

Welcome to the master repository for [Author Carpentry] (http://libguides.caltech.edu/authorcarpentry), a training and outreach program initiated at the Caltech Library to enhance scientific authorship and publishing in the digital age. The aim of Author Carpentry is to promote and support good information handling tools, practices, and skills that help researchers prepare, submit, and publish contributions that add value to the scholarly record and invite others to adapt and build upon. Ideally, that means contributions that fulfill not only the original Big Four of the scholarly record --

1. Registration

2. Validation

3. Dissemination

4. Preservation

**But also enable an essential fifth component of knowledge management in the digital age**:

  5\. Replication, Reuse, and Remixing

In conceiving of the Author Carpentry program, our hope is to advance production and curation of the *Research Paper of the Future*, crafted as a fully open, executable, reproducible, reusable contribution ready to be rendered, tested, mined, adapted, and built upon by humans and machines. We believe that research outputs belong to all and are of greatest use and impact when crafted as freely open, interoperable, and reuseable knowledge resources for humans and machines.

Author Carpentry lessons are agnostic to the mode of 'publication', recognizing that the term connotes a range of dissemination choices in the Internet Age (self-archiving in a pre-print server, sharing via a reputable online repository, micro publication on a blog, tweet, or other web service, or by peer-reviewed journal or refereed book.) Author Carpentry lessons rely on open source tools and open access data to get a task done, but recognize that there are many ways to skin even an Open cat -- the approaches demonstrated in these lessons reflect what we are comfortable using.  __Important fineprint: The particular applications and tools we demonstrate do not represent endorsement by Caltech__.

## Connection between Author Carpentry and Software/Data Carpentry

Author Carpentry is not an official Software/Data Carpentry project but it draws inspiration and encouragement from those sucessful communities that model  high impact instructional design, effective peer to peer teaching, and sensible assessment. We aim to build on the success of Software and Data Carpentry in promoting and teaching "good enough" skills for research information handling beyond software and code. SWC founder Greg Wilson's draft lesson [Modern Scientific Authoring] (http://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/01-mess.html) speaks to the need for training in writing, publishing, citation, and more. Discussions with members of the Carpentry and Research Data Alliance communities, and input from the June 2-3 2016 Mozilla Science Sprint, have confirmed broad interest in the lessons being designed for Author Carpentry and provided encouragement to develop pilot lessons for testing and implementation. 

## Why would Librarians be involved in Carpentry?

Research librarians have long shared expertise in authoring and publishing with our campus communities, and we have developed considerable expertise in knowledge management principles and practices; instruction and assessment; information ethics and law, responsible conduct of research; and research information systems. Moreover, we share a vision for equal and universal access to information and culture as a basic human right, enthusiastically promoting the goals of the Open Source, Open Science, and Open Access movements. 

The Caltech Library is recasting its instructional program using a 'Carpentry' approach to better meet the needs of successful, time-constrained, and (understandably) often pre-occupied scientists and scholars, while advancing new forms of scholarly communication that improve access, re-use, and replication of scientific claims. The desired outcome is a set of pragmatic, efficient and useful Author Carpentry lessons that can be offered alone as 'tips and tools' sessions; in combination as a half-day or full-day workshop; or as snap-on modules to enhance existing Open Science and Research Data management programs. 

## Topics covered in Author Carpentry include

* Scientific writing in useful, powerful, and open mark-up languages such as LaTeX and Markdown; 
* Formulating and managing citation data, publication lists, and bibliographies in open formats such as BiBTeX and using open source tools such as JabRef;
* Transforming author's  metadata documenting their research outputs into open plain text formats using command line tools, for reuse in research information systems in support of funder compliance mandates and institutional reporting.
* Establishing scholarly identity with ORCiD and managing reputation with ORCiD-enabled research information systems (ImpactStory, OpenVIVO) 
* Determining authorship, contributorship, and copyright ownership in collaborative research projects
* Demonstrating best practices in attribution, acknowledgement, and citation, particularly for non-traditional research outputs (software, datasets)
* Identifying reputable Open Access publications
* Scholarly annotation and open peer review
* Investigating and managing copyright status of a work, and evaluating conditions for Fair Use
* Open sharing of research using Creative Commons licenses, waivers, and public domain marks

## Get Involved
AuthorCarpentry is an Open Project and we enthusiastically welcome contributions of librarian and other research professionals. Anyone with an interest in the material is welcome to take part. The project is being co-ordinated by [Gail Clement](gclement@library.caltech.edu) at Caltech Library. Please get in touch or register your ideas on the Issues section.
