<h1>Author Carpentry</h1>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.7907/Z96H4FFZ">https://doi.org/10.7907/Z96H4FFZ</a></p>

<p>Welcome to the master repository for Author Carpentry , a researcher-to-researcher training and outreach program in open authoring and publishing, scholarly identity and reputation, and research impact. Inspired by the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/">Modern Scientific Authoring</a> program proposed by Software Carpentry founder Greg Wilson, AuthorCarpentry builds on Greg&rsquo;s vision to complement and extend the research pipelines covered in Software and Data Carpentry. AuthorCarpentry picks up with  the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; of the research process: writing, reporting, review, dissemination and licensing, impact measurement, and establishing author identity and reputation (as shown in the illustration below).</p>

<h2>Topics covered in Author Carpentry include</h2>

<ul>
<li>Scientific writing in useful, powerful, and open mark-up languages such as LaTeX and Markdown;</li>
<li>Formulating and managing citation data, publication lists, and bibliographies in open formats such as BiBTeX and using open source tools such as JabRef;</li>
<li>Transforming author&rsquo;s  metadata documenting their research outputs into open plain text formats using command line tools, for reuse in research information systems in support of funder compliance mandates and institutional reporting.</li>
<li>Establishing scholarly identity with ORCiD and managing reputation with ORCiD-enabled shclarly sharing platforms such as ScienceOpen</li>
<li>Determining authorship, contributorship, and copyright ownership in collaborative research projects</li>
<li>Demonstrating best practices in attribution, acknowledgement, and citation, particularly for non-traditional research outputs (software, datasets)</li>
<li>Identifying reputable Open Access publications</li>
<li>Scholarly annotation and open peer review</li>
<li>Investigating and managing copyright status of a work, and evaluating conditions for Fair Use</li>

<h2>Why would Librarians be involved in Author Carpentry?</h2>

<p>Research librarians have long shared expertise in authoring and publishing with our campus communities, and we have developed considerable expertise in knowledge management principles and practices; instruction and assessment; information ethics and law, responsible conduct of research; and research information systems. Moreover, we share a vision for equal and universal access to information and culture as a basic human right, enthusiastically promoting the goals of the Open Source, Open Science, and Open Access movements.</p>

<p>The Caltech Library is recasting its instructional program using a &lsquo;Carpentry&rsquo; approach to better meet the needs of successful, time-constrained, and (understandably) often pre-occupied scientists and scholars, while advancing new forms of scholarly communication that improve access, re-use, and replication of scientific claims. The desired outcome is a set of pragmatic, efficient and useful Author Carpentry lessons that can be offered alone as &lsquo;tips and tools&rsquo; sessions; in combination as a half-day or full-day workshop; or as snap-on modules to enhance existing Open Science and Research Data management programs.</p>
