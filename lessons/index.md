| ------ |:---: | :--------: | :--------------: | ------------- |
| Persistent access for research outputs with Digital Object Identifiers | [http://authorcarpentry.github.io/dois-citation-data] | [/dois-citation-data] | | Gail Peretsman-Clement | 


### Persistent access for research outputs with Digital Object Identifiers (dois-citation-data) (Gail)

- Resolve a valid Digital Object Identifier to an online landing page to determine what information is returned
- Test an invalid Digital Object Identifier (a DOI-like string) to determine what information is returned
- Use the DOI resolution system to determine which Registration Agency maintains a given DOI
- Determine open access availability of a digital resource using DOAI system vs the DOI resolver (is there an open license associated with this resource? And where does the open version reside if not deposited in CrossRef?)
- Identify the components of a Digital Object Identifier and how they are assigned
- Gain experience with the UNIX curl command to obtain information from the API services of CrossRef and DataCite DOI Registration Agencies
- Obtain a DOI for a research contribution from a DOI member organization such 
- Obtaining Open Citations with BibTeX and JSON to produce an open publications list
- Parse into human readable form the citation metadata for a valid DOI returned in json format
- Apply content negotiation commands to a request from the CrossRef API to obtain a citation for a given DOI in BibTeX and APA Style
- Gain experience with UNIX command line tools to concatenate the citations into a single BibTeX publication list for use in various Research Information Systems

### Establishing Scholarly Identity with Online Research Contributor Identifiers (OrCiDs) (orcid-profile) (Gail)
- Register for an ORCiD account and activate it  (or look up an existing ORCiD)
- Logon to ORCiD and account and populate basic account fields
- Apply desired privacy settings
- Set up a delegate to assist with maintaining account
- Enter one work manually
- Enter one work using the Crossref or DataCite wizard
- Enter one work using the Scopus or ResearcherID wizard
- Enter a list of works using the bibtex upload feature
- Compare displayed citations from various input approaches and deduplicate records

### Measuring scholarly impact and reputation with ORCiD and ImpactStory (orcid-and-impact) (Gail)
- Create an impact Story account and link to OrcID
- Observe OAuth token granted to ImpactStory to access ORCID account and its duration
- Observe metrics displaying next to works harvested from the OrCiD profile

### Fair Attribution for Contributorship with Project Credit taxonomy (contributor-and-credit) (Gail)
- Review Project CreDIt Taxonomy maintained by CASRAI
- Review published article where CredIt Taxonomy has been applied
- Create an Open VIVO account and link to OrCiD
- Complete questionnaire about contributor roles for each work harvested from the OrCiD Profile
- Display public version of OpenVivo Profile to see how others can assess your contributions to various research outputs

### Authoring LaTeX paper with BibTeX bibliography (latex-bibtex-authoring) (Gail)
- Open a template for a LaTex formatted paper and replace gibberish with relevant content from your own work
- Upload a BibTeX citation list and use it to add references to the paper
- Add a figure to the paper 
- Compile the paper to cleanly a typeset PDF

### Open licensing with Creative Commons (licensing-cc) (Gail)
- Review the spectrum of rights applied to research outputs from copyright to public domain
- Review the types of Creative Commons licenses to gain familiarity with their restrictions
- Given examples of CC-licensed resources, list three allowable uses and how to attribute the CC-licenses resource in the new work
- Given an example of a CC-Zero work, list two allowable uses and how to attribute the CC-licenses resource in the new work
- Use an Internet Search tool (e.g., Google) to find resources of interest that are distributed with a CC license

### Identifying reputable Open Access Journals (reputable-oa) (Gail)
- Review criteria for reputable open access journals established by Directory of Open Access Journals and COPE
- Apply those criteria to an actual predatory  journal (as evidence by the fact it  is being prosecuted by US Government)
- Apply those criteria to another OA journal of your choice to determine if it is reputable
- Using the DOAJ datafile and OpenRefine, create a custom list of 10 reputable OA journals in your field of interest

### Transforming Textual Data for Reuse and Republication with XML and XSL (transforming-xml) (tbd)
- See original lesson from Programming Historian but adapt for Author Carpentry audience http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/transforming-xml-with-xsl

### Sustainable Authorship with Markdown and Pandoc (markdown-pandoc) (Sebastian)
- See original lesson from Programming Historian but adapt for Author Carpentry audience
http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown

### Using Markdown and github to author for web and print (markdown-github-webpages) (Sebastian)
- Using Jekyll to transform markdown into webpages
- Setting up a workflow to create both html and PDF/ebook version

### Creating executable documents using RStudio and Rmarkdown (executable-documents-rstudio) (Sebastian)
- Using RStudio as a markdown environment
- Integrating your data and code with your document
- Creating figures in your document

### Using Zotero, Wordpress, and ZotPress to generate active bibliographies on the web (zotero-wordpress) (Sebastian)
- Basic of the Zotero API
- Introduction to Zotpress
- Create a bibliography from a collection in your Zotero library on Wordpress

### Reference management and text-based writing (reference-management) (Sebastian)
- Using bibtex output from popular reference managers
- Integrating Zotero into a pandoc-based writing workflow 


### Open Annotation Lesson (open-annotation) (tbd)
- Content Unclear
